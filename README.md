# **FlipperLite – A Low-Cost 433MHz Signal Analyzer & Emulator**  

## **Overview**  
FlipperLite is a **low-cost alternative to the Flipper Zero**, built using an **ESP32** to **analyze, capture, and emulate 433MHz signals**. It connects seamlessly to a **mobile app** over **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**, allowing users to **save, edit, rename, and manage** signals through a **gamified interface**.  

## **Features**  
### **ESP32 Firmware**  
✅ Capture & decode **433MHz RF signals**  
✅ Save & replay signals on demand  
✅ Communicate with the mobile app over **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth**  

### **Mobile App**  
✅ **Gamified UI** for managing signals (save, rename, edit)  
✅ Real-time connectivity with ESP32  
✅ Secure & scalable architecture for future expansions  

## **Hardware Requirements**  
- ESP32  
- RF Receiver (433MHz)  
- RF Transmitter (433MHz)  
- OLED Display (optional for standalone mode)  
- LiPo Battery & Charging Circuit  

## **Software Stack**  
### **ESP32 Firmware**  
- **Platform:** Arduino / ESP-IDF  
- **Libraries:** RadioHead, ESPAsyncWebServer, Wi-FiManager  

### **Mobile App**  
- **Framework:** React Native / Flutter  
- **State Management:** Redux / Provider  
- **Networking:** WebSockets / BLE  

## **Installation & Setup**  
### **1️⃣ Setting Up ESP32**  
1. Flash the firmware using **Arduino IDE / ESP-IDF**.  
2. Connect ESP32 to Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.  
3. Attach the **433MHz receiver & transmitter**.  

### **2️⃣ Running the Mobile App**  
1. Clone the repository.  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flipperlite.git
   cd flipperlite
   ```
2. Install dependencies.  
   ```bash
   npm install  # For React Native
   flutter pub get  # For Flutter
   ```
3. Run the app on your device.  
   ```bash
   npm run android  # React Native  
   flutter run  # Flutter  
   ```

## **How It Works**  
1. **Capture Signals:** The ESP32 listens for 433MHz signals and decodes them.  
2. **Save & Edit:** Users can store, rename, and modify signals in the app.  
3. **Replay & Emulate:** The ESP32 transmits saved signals on command.  

## **Future Improvements**  
🚀 Expand support to other frequencies (e.g., **868MHz, 2.4GHz**).  
🎮 Add more **gamification elements** like badges and unlockable tools.  
🔒 Implement **encrypted signal storage** for security.
